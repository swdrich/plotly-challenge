# Belly Button Microbiome Survey

![Petri Dish Image From Subject 940](/Images/940.jpg)

For this project, I used data from the NC State [Belly Button Biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) project to visualize the results of their study of the microbiome that exists inside everyone's belly button.

I used JavaScript, HTML, Plotly, and D3 to build a dashboard that displays the sample results from each test subject.
